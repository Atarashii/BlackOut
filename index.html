                    <p>This site is a continuous passion project where I'll be pushing my programming and creative
                        skills. This is to combat signs of creative burnout, and sometimes just to give me a nice outlet
                        during the fun 6-9 months of winter where I live.</p>

                    <h3>
                        This is the inspiration that lead to this site becoming a thing.
                    </h3>
                    <p>This all started out as a small dev challenge to try and make a small text based ARPG, and as I
                        spent more time working on this without any of the other participants actually taking part, it
                        kinda got out of hand.</p>
                    <p>The original idea was supposed to just be a couple of encounters with some choices and like 5
                        steps, but I am a gamer, a dev, and a creative. I've always wanted to create something
                        interactive, and obviously all inspiration has source.</p>
                    <p>The main sources I can think of at this time would be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fallout 1 & 2 (Aesthetics).</li>
                        <li>Final space's H.U.E. for his sassy personality.</li>
                        <li>Old RPG clicker games like Space Quest and Heretic.</li>
                        <li>and many, many more...</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The other part of this was the technological challenge. Sure I could use something like
                        GameDevStudio or Unity to create a good-looking game, but that didn't interest me as much. I
                        want to struggle, I wanted to figure out how far I can push my skills in TypeScript, JavaScript,
                        HTML, Scss. Using interesting new architecture and becoming more and more adept at these
                        languages and technologies. But most of all, I wanted to have fun and make something that is fun
                        for other people to experience.</p>
                    <p>Follow along as I continue to create and update and upgrade this weird and wacky adventure, and
                        who knows? maybe you'll find yourself learning something, feeling something, experiencing
                        something, or maybe even earn yourself a cameo in the game.</p>
